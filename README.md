# NeuroMoveSystems_PCTO
This repository contains all the programs written during PCTO hours, both at school and at home in the afternoon. To play this video game you will need:
1) a Microbit
2) a USB battery or cable to connect to a computer

If you are playing for the first time you need to drag the microbit-BLEAllInOne.hex file onto the Microbit (from the Resource Explorer).

For more information on how our game works, please visit our website: https://giacomofresia.github.io/
