    <h2>The Rehabilitation Game</h2>
    <p>
      Our rehabilitation software is based on a ski video game specifically designed to support multiple sclerosis patients during their motor rehabilitation journey. The main goal is to transform physical exercises into an engaging and motivating experience, reducing the perception of fatigue and increasing consistency in therapy.
      The patient interacts with the video game through the movement of the arms or the Microbit, which are detected by special sensors. The movements are translated in real time into the movements of a virtual skier moving along a track.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system uses hand lifting and moving to control the skier's direction. When the patient moves himself or the Microbit, the virtual character moves to the right or left, simulating the actual movement of the ski.
      This type of interaction allows for targeted training of upper limb mobility, improving strength, coordination, and motor control. The patient performs functional movements that are natural and easily repeatable, making the exercise more effective from a rehabilitation point of view.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the course, the skier must pass through flags positioned along the track. This mechanism introduces a component of attention, precision, and timing, which stimulates not only physical movement but also cognitive and hand-eye coordination skills.
      The activity helps the patient improve movement control, stability, and responsiveness. Furthermore, the presence of clear objectives within the game increases motivation and makes rehabilitation more like a playful activity rather than a simple repetitive exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NeuroMove system was specifically designed to support patients with multiple sclerosis, a condition that can impair mobility, coordination, and muscle strength. Through the use of video games, the patient can perform targeted exercises in a controlled and safe environment.
      The play-based approach promotes greater adherence to the therapeutic path, as the patient perceives the activity as more pleasant and less stressful. Furthermore, the software allows you to adapt the difficulty level based on individual abilities, ensuring personalized and progressive training.

    <h3>Videogame versions</h3>
    <div class="software-versione">
      <p>
        NeuroMove is available in a version that uses a video camera to recognize the patient's movements. Thanks to sophisticated tracking algorithms, the system detects the lifting and tilting of the arms in real time, translating them into the movements of the virtual skier. This technology allows the patient to interact naturally with the video game, without having to wear additional devices, ensuring an immersive and intuitive experience that stimulates both motor control and hand-eye coordination.

      <p>
        The second version of the software uses a Micro: bit device to detect the patient's movements and transfer them to the virtual skier. In this case, the Micro: bit records changes in position and inclination, allowing the skier to move precisely along the track. Although using different sensing technology, the game's behavior remains identical: the patient's movements are translated with the same fluidity and immediacy, ensuring consistency between the two versions and allowing the most suitable solution to be chosen for the rehabilitation station and the patient's needs.

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The patient moves his arms</li>
      <li>Sensors detect movement</li>
      <li>The skier moves left and right</li>
      <li>Patient avoids flags on route</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rehabilitation objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve upper limb mobility</li>
      <li>Increase coordination and motor control</li>
      <li>Making therapy more engaging</li>
    </ul>
